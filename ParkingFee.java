Problem: Parking Fee Calculation
A parking system calculates the fee based on the following conditions:

Vehicle Type:
Car: â‚¹50 per hour
Bike: â‚¹30 per hour
Truck: â‚¹100 per hour


Discounts:
If the vehicle stays for more than 5 hours, a 20% discount is applied to the total parking fee.

Surcharge:
If the vehicle is parked between 6 PM and 8 AM, a 50% surcharge is applied to the total fee.

Input:
The program should prompt the user to enter the vehicle type (Car, Bike, or Truck).
The user should enter the arrival time (24-hour format, e.g., 14 for 2 PM).
The user should also enter the departure time (24-hour format, e.g., 18 for 6 PM).


Output:
The program should output the total parking fee based on the conditions above.

Constraints:
Assume that the parking times are in a 24-hour format.
Handle cases where parking times cross midnight (e.g., a vehicle parked from 10 PM to 2 AM).
For vehicles staying for more than 5 hours, apply the 20% discount.
For vehicles parked between 6 PM and 8 AM, apply the 50% surcharge.


Example:
Input:
Enter the vehicle type (Car, Bike, Truck): car
Enter the time of arrival (24-hour format, e.g., 14 for 2 PM): 14
Enter the time of departure (24-hour format, e.g., 18 for 6 PM): 20

Output:
Total parking fee: â‚¹300.0*/
